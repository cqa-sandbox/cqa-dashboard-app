# Link test repositories to dashboard

Modify Playwright github actions in the test repositories to notify and update dashboard to the latest test results:

1. Create a personal access token named `DASHBOARD_REPORT_PAT` with `repo` and `workflow` permissions
      1. If the organization your dashboard is located in requires SSO enable SSO for the PAT token
2. In the GitHub settings of the test repository or its organization, add the personal access token `DASHBOARD_REPORT_PAT` to its actions secrets
      ![Location of actions secrets](./img/actions-secrets.png)
3. Append the following steps to the `playwright-onDemand.yml` file below the current steps in the `test` job.

    ```yaml
        - name: Get current date
          id: date
          run: echo "::set-output name=date::$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"
        - name: Upload HTML report as Artifact
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
          if: always()
          with: 
            name: onDemand
            path: pw-report/
    
      storeReports:
        name: Store reports
        if: ${{ always() }}
        needs: test
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        - name: Download all workflow run artifacts
          uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
          id: download
        - name: Publish to external repo
          if: always()
          uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.7.3
          with:
            external_repository: mspnp/intern-js-pipeline
            publish_branch: gh-pages
            personal_token: ${{ secrets.DASHBOARD_REPORT_PAT }}
            publish_dir: ${{steps.download.outputs.download-path}}
            destination_dir: test-reports/${{ github.repository }}
            keep_files: true
            user_name: "github-actions[bot]"
            user_email: "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    
      notify-dashboard:
        name: Notify Dashboard
        if: ${{ always() }}
        needs: [test, storeReports]
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:
          # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
          # Runs a single command using the runners shell
          - name: Notify docusaurus repo
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DASHBOARD_REPORT_PAT }}
            run: |
              gh api repos/mspnp/intern-js-pipeline/dispatches \
                  --raw-field event_type=rebuild-site
    ```

      As a result the `playwright-onDemand.yml` file should look similar to the following code with extra lines to install additional dependencies if required.

    ```yaml
    # This workflow will do a clean installation of node dependencies, cache/restore them, build the source code and run tests across different versions of node
    # For more information see: https://help.github.com/actions/language-and-framework-guides/using-nodejs-with-github-actions
    
    name: Playwright tests
    
    on:
      # Runs on push or pull requests and nightly
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ "main" ]
      schedule: 
        # nightly
        - cron: '0 0 * * *'
    
    jobs:
      test:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        strategy:
          matrix:
            node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
            # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/
    
        steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        - name: Install dependencies

        - name: Get current date
          id: date
          run: echo "::set-output name=date::$(date +'%Y-%m-%d')"
        - name: Upload HTML report as Artifact
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
          env:

        steps:

            user_email: "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    
      notify-dashboard:
        name: Notify Dashboard
        if: ${{ always() }}
        needs: [test, storeReports]
        # The type of runner that the job will run on
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
        steps:
          # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
          # Runs a single command using the runners shell
          - name: Notify docusaurus repo
            env:
              GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DASHBOARD_REPORT_PAT }}
            run: |
              gh api repos/mspnp/intern-js-pipeline/dispatches \
                  --raw-field event_type=rebuild-site
    ```

      This allows the `test` job to store the Playwright artifact. `storeReports` then pushes the Playwright artifact to a folder in the dashboard's `gh_pages`. Lastly, `notify-dashboard` sends a trigger to the dashboard notifying it to rebuild.

4. Change the value of `external_repository` under the `storeReports` job from `mspnp/intern-js-pipeline` to the dashboard's organization and repository name
5. In the `notify-dashboard` job, replace `mspnp/intern-js-pipeline` in `repos/mspnp/intern-js-pipeline/dispatches` with the dashboard's organization and repository name
6. Triggering the playwright Github action should now cause the dashboard's rebuild workflow to execute
